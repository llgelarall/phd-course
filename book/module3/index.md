# 3. Event-based sensing

We have seen how neurons can compute and how we can optimize their spatial **and** temporal components.
We also saw that interneural communication happens with discrete *events*, so-called "spikes".
Now, we will see how sensors can provide us with spiking data and how we can work with that using our newfound knowledge about neurons and computation.
