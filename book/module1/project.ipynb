    "For control problems, spiking models such as the LIF model, are surprisingly useful.\n",
    "We can interpret the firing/non-firing of the neuron as a means to turn on and off a signal. On when the neuron is firing (`1`). Off when the neuron is silent (`0`).\n",

    "Spiking neural systems are useful for control systems because we can exploit the temporal dynamics to react to stimulus in the environment.\n",
    "On this page, we use the leaky integrator (LI) and leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) models to solve simple problems with very few neurons."

    "There is now a feedback loop between the mouse (agent) that 1) receives sensory observations, it can then 2) mull over in its artificial brain, so that it 3) can act upon the environment - probably with the hopes of fetching cheese.\n",
    "\n",
    "Zooming in on the brain, we can imagine the sensory signal (say, distance to cheese) can translate quite directly to a motor output: if the cheese if far away, go faster. Otherwise, stop and enjoy the cheese.\n",

    "Note that the code above is identical to the diagram we drew before: we create a leaky integrator (`LIBoxCell`), apply a certain current, and scale it by a factor of 2.\n",

    "1. We provide input to `n` neurons that each code for some signal (like distance to food)\n",
    "2. We read the neuron response output (like neuron voltage or spike)\n",
