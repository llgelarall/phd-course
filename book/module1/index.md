# 1. Computing with neurons

In this module we will take a first look at neurons from a computational perspective.
According to the [neuron doctrine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuron_doctrine) neurons are the main units of computation in biological nervous systems.
In this course, we will focus less on the biological plausibility and more on the computational function.
What are their purpose? What can they do?
